#                   Safe Pattern Pruning Algorithm
#######################################################################


"""
1. Implement a function allowing to give the required patterns under the
proper format to the SPP Algorithm. In this step, perform a binning process
over the continuous variables so as to obtain discrete one-hot encoded features
from which we can create interactions variables.

2. Implement a function which from a given subtree is able to compute the
value of lambda max.

3. Implement the SPP algorithm which scans the tree built over the whole set of
patterns from the root to the leaf and for each node t that tests the SPPC(t).
If the SPPC(t) is satisfied it prunes the whole subtree, otherwise it leaves
it. For the scan of the tree from the root to the leaves, look at depth at
first search algorithm.
At the end of the pruning process, we form the active set with all the patterns
which remain in the tree i.e. which have not been pruned out.

4. Implement a solver allowing to run an optimization process over the active
set A hat. (sparse_cd)

5. Implement a grid search over the lambdas which runs SPP algorithms for
each value of lambda of the grid. The values of lambda in the grid search start
from lambda max and evenly decrease until a very small lambda to obtain a
solution always more dense.
For each value of lambda in the grid, run a SPP algorithm in order
to find the active set A hat. Once A hat have been determined, run the
optimization process thanks to the implemented Lasso solver.

6. At each iteration of the grid search, we obtain a couple of primal dual
solutions, store for each lambda these solutions and return the whole set of
primal / dual solutions.
